						<b>What is Relief Call?</b> <br/>

Relief Call is a nonprofit venture started by a bunch of engineers to help Chronic Kidney Disease patients. Our concentration is mainly on unprivileged patients who are under HaemoDialysis and we’re restricted to Mysore region.
<br/></p>
  <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;"> 
<b>How it started?</b>
<br/>
Everything begins with passion, with feelings and a story behind it. Every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end. Relief Call is such a beginning that hit our head when a trauma called dialysis ended in one of our friend’s family.
<br/>
When we realized that there are so many out there who really can’t afford a prescribed number of dialysis per week due to financial problems, a toddler called ‘Relief Call’ came into existence to help those who are in need of financial help for HaemoDialysis treatment.
<br/></p>
  <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;"> 
<b>Why we started Relief Call?</b>
<br/>
Kidney failure or CKD is one such disease where the treatment is really not affordable. We can break down the cost of treatment as follows,
<ol class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
<li>Dialysis Cost.</li>
<li>Dialyser Cost.</li>
<li>Regular Medicines.</li>
<li>Blood work every month.</li>
<li>Regular Checkups.</li>
<li>Blood transfusions.</li>
<li>Emergency can hit anytime.</li></ol>
</p><p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
Physical trauma the patient goes through and the emotional trauma the family faces is unbearable added to it one has to be financially stable as the treatment is costly and not affordable to all.
<br/></p>
  <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;"> 
One has to ideally get dialysed thrice a week which counts up to 12 dialysis per month. Relief Call’s aim is to collect funds from the people who are willing to donate for this cause and help few unprivileged patients by providing a financial help through subsidized dialysis after a thorough background check done by our volunteers. Join our hands and support us for the cause. After all, one human can save another.

			<p class="lead">“At first his legs got swollen, he doesn’t feel hungry now and he’s deteriorating day by day. Dialysis is prescribed for three days a week. The treatment is very costly and all we can afford is two dialysis a week.” Said the wife of a CKD patient.
<br/>
Kidney failure is one of the fast growing disease these days and the treatment is not really affordable for many. This is when we, the bunch of engineers got this idea of “Relief.” Relief is a budding venture to help Chronic kidney disease patients right now at the stage of survey. Currently we are limited to Mysore region. Help us to identify those who are in need and we’ll try our best to help them. We need all your support to help the unprivileged.

Firstly I appreciate the TEAM for taking up such an initiative to help people in their difficulty. There are people who really can’t afford for dialysis thrice in a week and who just get it done only once, Just because of lack of money!.

This small help from all of us going to make a big difference in their lives. I really hope people will join our hands to make this great start an successfull story. Let’s all give our best to help one another. As rightly said – one human can help another.</p>

That one trauma can cost a death of a important person in your life. So at least find peace and relief by not making other go through that trauma again!

There’s always some relief in helping people who are the victims of chronic disease.

Seeing your dear ones being Ill is like a nightmare, Awakening someone from nightmare could be a relief. Working for money might kill you one day. But working for a cause can save a life.  😊 #relief.</p>

									Relief!!
They say, we only learn the value of a person after we loose them, and we learn it the hard way. It’s funny how we struggle with life wondering when all the pain and suffering would end. Happiness and sadness go hand in hand in life and with the right support, the journey is bearable. But that one savior or support is not easy to find.

We take a lot for granted and overestimate our short life. We can never understand what life is all about and what may happen when. Its better to be safe than sorry.

It takes a small initiative to make all the difference in the world and that change can start within you, all you need is to have a little confidence to go the extra mile. Nothing too big, but a small change can make all the difference in the world.

A dear friend, has stated a noble foundation called “Relief” to support patients suffering from various kidney diseases. What ‘Relief’ doing is truly an eye opener and such initiatives need our full support. A big shout out to his whole team and here’s wishing him and his team all the very best for all their future endeavors.

									We are so much caught up in our day-to-day lives that we often fail to realise the fact that we are very lucky to be healthy, that there are people who are not as lucky as we are. It is always painful to see people who are suffering from illness or have lost a near one to some kind of illness.

Relief is founded to help people who have CKD and cannot afford dialysis, by helping them get dialysis at a subsidizedrate. This is a noble cause, which we hope brings some kind of relief to these people. We hope more people will join us in helping those who are in need.

									I still remember the day when I heard the term dialysis for the first time. I was in 5th grade and it was my dad who said that his dear sister is undergoing dialysis. I could feel the love, care, affection and fear in my dad’s voice when he stated that people undergoing dialysis might not live much longer. And a week after, we received the sad news of death of my aunt who breathed her last at her third dialysis procedure. Thats when I realized how deadly a disease chronic kidney disorder is! Well, there were many such incidents which got me closer to dialysis patients! One of my mother’s colleague, my mother’s brother, a relative of a dearest friend and the list goes on! This made me realize that CKD is one of the most commom diseases nowadays! Infact, one of the facts states that “Every year, kidney disease kills more people than breast or prostate cancer”.

There are many difficulties a dialysis patient goes through. The main reason is the treatment being not really affordable! 2-3 dialysis per week, expensive regular medicines/injections/surgeries, travel cost and what not! As per one of the analysis, dialysis expenditures for patients over a long period rank the highest among all major traumas and diseases. And in India, majority of patients on dialysis are ‘self paying’ because of limited health insurance coverage available from government as well as private insurance providers. Being not able to bear the expenses, having a feeling of being burden to their family, going through the dialysis pain- all these might affect a patient’s mental health and force him to enter depression. One of the studies state that dialysis patients diagnosed with depression are nearly twice as likely to be hospitalized or die within a year as those who are not depressed.

When we think of the ways to help a dialysis patient, there is nothing much we can do! We cant share their physical pain. All we can do is to find some ways to keep patients mentally healthy and strong and make them realize that they are not alone in their journey. And the only way that we can achieve this is by helping under previliged financially. Sacrificing a small part of our expense will turn into a great relief in CKD patient’s life. Please join our hands in making CKD patient’s life better and bearable! After all, every human being on earth has the right to be happy! #reliefcall

									All one needs in life is a moment of satisfaction. How better to achieve it than to help another person in his time of need. That one act of kindness is all that is needed to live a better life. That is what relief means to me, an act of kindness and help to others in need.
